# React: Past, Present, and Future
## By Sawyer

---

## Overview
- Brief history of the React component
- Common issues with using React components to solve problems
- How hooks try to address some of these issues

---

## Beginnings of React
- React was created at Facebook in 2011
- Spawned out of [BoltJS](https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/29/boltjs/)
- The original version of Bolt was written in OCaml
- React was open sourced in 2013 and grew in popularity overtime

---

## Controversial Syntax
- React started out with a very controversial syntax enhancement, JSX
- Directly taken from Facebook's PHP language extension XHP

<Highlighter language="php" style={darcula}>
{`<?hh // strict
$user_name = 'Fred';
echo <tt>Hello <strong>{$user_name}</strong></tt>;`}
</Highlighter>

## Making Components

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
{`
React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return {count: 0};
  },
  onClick() {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  },
  render() {
    return <button onClick={onClick}>{this.state.count}</button>
  }
});
`}
</Highlighter>

---

import CreateClassCounter from './example/createClass'

<CreateClassCounter />

---

## React.createClass
- Pre-ES6 a factory function was used to emulate classes for PHP developers
- React was designed to avoid prototypical inheritance
- All methods are auto bound
  - You can use object literal syntax without calling `.bind`
- Component composition was used for visual composition
- *Mixins* were used for sharing logic between components

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
{`const SetIntervalMixin = {
  componentWillMount: function() {
    this.intervals = [];
  },
  setInterval: function() {
    this.intervals.push(setInterval.apply(null, arguments));
  },
  componentWillUnmount: function() {
    this.intervals.forEach(clearInterval);
  }
};
${''}
React.createClass({
  mixins: [SetIntervalMixin],
  getInitialState() {
    return {count: 0};
  },
  componentDidMount() {
    this.setInterval(
      () => this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1}), 1000
    )
  },
  render() {
    return <button style={{fontSize: '10vh'}}>{this.state.count}</button>
  }
})`}
</Highlighter>

---

import Mixin from './example/mixin';

<Mixin />

---
## Mixins facilitate all sorts of logic sharing
* Initial flux store adapters used mixins
* This gave you the ability to share lifecycle logic and state between components
* There were mixins for drag and drop, subscribing to data, etc.
* The main issue is collision, mixin names could conflict

---

## ES6 (When JS became good)
* Tons of features that are commonplace to JS got added
* `let/const`
* Modules
* `Map/Set`
* Arrow Functions
* *Classes*

---
<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
{`class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {count: 0}
  ${''}
  onClick = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    })
  }
  ${''}
  render() {
    return <button onClick={onClick}>{this.state.count}</button>
  }
}`}
</Highlighter>

---

## Class Components
* No longer had to emulate a class syntax!
* Lost the magic of auto-binding functions (but we got arrow functions!)
* Lost Mixins (extending components is a worse version of that)
* New patterns for sharing logic between components
