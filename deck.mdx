# React: Past, Present, and Future

## By Sawyer

---

## Overview

- Brief history of the React component
- Common patterns for reusing functionality in React
- How hooks try to address some of these issues

---

## Beginnings of React

- React was created at Facebook in 2011
- Spawned out of [BoltJS](https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/29/boltjs/)
- The original version of Bolt was written in OCaml
- React was open sourced in 2013 and grew in popularity overtime

---

## Controversial Syntax

- React started out with a very controversial syntax enhancement, JSX
- Directly taken from Facebook's PHP language extension XHP

<Highlighter language="php" style={darcula}>
  {`<?hh // strict
$user_name = 'Fred';
echo <tt>Hello <strong>{$user_name}</strong></tt>;`}
</Highlighter>

---

## Making Components (circa 2013)

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return {count: 0};
  },
  onClick() {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  },
  render() {
    return <button onClick={onClick}>{this.state.count}</button>
  }
});
`}
</Highlighter>

---

import CreateClassCounter from "./example/createClass"

<CreateClassCounter />

---

## React.createClass

- Pre-ES6 a factory function was used to emulate classes for PHP developers
- React was designed to avoid prototypical inheritance
- All methods are auto bound
  - You can use object literal syntax without calling `.bind`
- Component composition was used for visual composition
- _Mixins_ were used for sharing logic between components

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`const SetIntervalMixin = {
  componentWillMount: function() {
    this.intervals = [];
  },
  setInterval: function() {
    this.intervals.push(setInterval.apply(null, arguments));
  },
  componentWillUnmount: function() {
    this.intervals.forEach(clearInterval);
  }
};
${""}
React.createClass({
  mixins: [SetIntervalMixin],
  getInitialState() {
    return {count: 0};
  },
  componentDidMount() {
    this.setInterval(
      () => this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1}), 1000
    )
  },
  render() {
    return <button style={{fontSize: '10vh'}}>{this.state.count}</button>
  }
})`}
</Highlighter>

---

import Mixin from "./example/mixin"

<Mixin />

---

## Mixins facilitate all sorts of logic sharing

- Initial flux store adapters used mixins
- This gave you the ability to share lifecycle logic and state between components
- There were mixins for drag and drop, subscribing to data, etc.
- The main issue is collision, mixin names could conflict

---

## ES6 (When JS became good)

- Tons of features that are commonplace to JS got added
- `let/const`
- Modules
- `Map/Set`
- Arrow Functions
- _Classes_

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {count: 0}
  ${""}
  onClick = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    })
  }
  ${""}
  render() {
    return <button onClick={onClick}>{this.state.count}</button>
  }
}`}
</Highlighter>

---

## Class Components (circa 2015)

- No longer had to emulate a class syntax!
- Lost the magic of auto-binding functions (but we got arrow functions!)
- Lost Mixins (extending components is a worse version of that)
- New patterns for sharing logic between components

---

## Cross cutting concerns without mixins

- Higher-Order Components
- Render Functions
- Extending React.Component

---

# Higher Order Component

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
function withSetInterval(Component) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    intervals = []
    setInterval = (...args) => {
      this.intervals.push(window.setInterval(...args))
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
      this.intervals.forEach(clearInterval)
    }
    render() {
      return <Component {...this.props} setInterval={this.setInterval} />
    }
  }
}
`}
</Highlighter>

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
const UpdateButton = withSetInterval(
  class extends React.Component {
    state = { count: 0 }
    componentDidMount() {
      this.props.setInterval(
        () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }),
        1000
      )
    }
    render() {
      return <button style={{ fontSize: "10vh" }}>{this.state.count}</button>
    }
  }
)
`}
</Highlighter>

---

import UpdateButton from "./example/hoc"

<UpdateButton />

---

## HOCs

- function that takes a component and returns a component
- the wrapping component is where the cross cutting concern is addressed
- set up is done on the component, not the call site/element
- Dependencies can be injected via props
- Redux `connect` is a great example of this

---

# Render Props

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
class IntervalContainer extends React.Component {
  intervals = []
  setInterval = (...args) => {
    this.intervals.push(window.setInterval(...args))
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.intervals.forEach(clearInterval)
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.children(this.setInterval)
  }
}
`}
</Highlighter>

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
class UpdateButton extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 0 }
  render() {
    return (
      <IntervalContainer>
        {(setInterval) => (
          <button
            onClick={() =>
              setInterval(
                () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }),
                1000
              )
            }
            style={{ fontSize: "10vh" }}
          >
            {this.state.count}
          </button>
        )}
      </IntervalContainer>
    )
  }
}
`}
</Highlighter>

---

import UpdateButtonRender from "./example/renderProp"

<UpdateButtonRender />

---

## Render Props

- A little simpler to understand than HOCs
- You inject the dependencies where you use the component
- It can be hard if you need to inject a dependency in a lifecycle method
- React uses these with `Context.Consumer`
- A great way to handle inversion of control with element creation
  - Ex: virtualized lists

---

## Problems with Existing Patterns

- Both HOCs and Render Props are bandaids for the lack of Mixins
- They lead to clunky syntax and are hard to mix multiples of
- Both have a non-zero performace overhead
  - HOCs render an extra component in the tree for every HOC
  - Render props can mess with PureComponents
- HOCs in particularly can throw static type checkers for a loop

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(
  withInterval(
    withDataSource(ButtonComponent)
  )
)
`}
</Highlighter>

---

## Problems with Lifecycle Methods

- Lifecycle methods are imperative and often go against the declarative nature of React
- The componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount duplication

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
class SubscriptionComponent extends React.Component {
  sub = null
  componentDidMount() {
    sub = setUpSubscription(this.props.postID)
  }
  componentDidUpdate({postID: oldPostID}) {
    if (sub && this.props.postID !== oldPostID) {
      sub.release()
      sub = setUpSubscription(this.props.postID)
    }
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.sub) {
      this.sub.release()
    }
  }
}
`}
</Highlighter>

---

## React's main problems

- It is hard to share stateful logic and effects between components
- Lifecycle methods are error prone and break stateful logic across the component
- Class components give people false security that they are working in an object oriented language
- Pave the way for a React optimizing compiler (like Svelte has)

---

## Hooks (circa 2018)

- Eliminante React Lifecycle methods
- Make it simple to share stateful logic with components
- Allow users to access many of React's features in a simpler way

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
class Button {
  state = {count: 0}
  onClick = () => {
    this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})
  }
  render() {
    return <button onClick={onClick}>{this.state.count}</button>
  }
}
`}
</Highlighter>

---

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
function Button() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
`}
</Highlighter>

---

import HookButton from "./example/statehook"

<HookButton />

---

## Hooks

- Functions that let you "hook into" React state/lifecycle features
- They are plain function calls, and they let React inject a return value
- Influenced by Effect Handlers in [Multicore OCaml](http://kcsrk.info/papers/system_effects_feb_18.pdf)

---

## 3 "BIG" Hooks

- useState
- useEffect
- useContext

---

## useState

- Way to access state in functional components
- Takes one argument which is the initial state (can take a lazy state init function as well)
- Teturns the current value of the state and a function to update the state
- **This does not merge updates**

<Highlighter language="jsx" style={darcula}>
  {`
function Button() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
`}
</Highlighter>
